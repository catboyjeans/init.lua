Lua engine nvim
    nvim has the following libraries available for lua
        - lua stdlib composed of:
            :lua print(vim.inspect(vim)), this inspects the whole vim.* module
            - 'editor stdlib' API
                interface to vimscript
                available through vim.*
                    - vimscript functions
                    - ex commands
            - the lua API
                available through vim.api.* specifically

Ex commands vs Built-in commands
    They are not the same

    Ex commands are called through the ':' interface
    Built-in commands are called either from a vimscript or through 
    the :call Ex command

runtimepath and searching modules
    runtime path is a list of comma separated directories

    first nvim looks for .lua modules, then searches for .dll or .so modules

    nvim adjusts package.cpath and package.path according to the 'runtimepath' value
    this happens anytime the runtimepath is changed

Package searchers
    --> https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#pdf-package.cpath

package.cpath
package.path
    they are a list of patterns with a '?' e.g.:
        ./?.so;./?.dll
    the question mark gets substituted by the name of the searched module
    
    These paths are only used if the .lua modules where not found

package.cpath vs package.path

    For example, if 'runtimepath' is `foo,bar` and |package.cpath| was
    `./?.so;./?.dll` at startup, `require('mod')` searches these paths in order
    and loads the first module found ("first wins"): >
        foo/lua/mod.lua
        foo/lua/mod/init.lua
        bar/lua/mod.lua
        bar/lua/mod/init.lua
        foo/lua/mod.so
        foo/lua/mod.dll
        bar/lua/mod.so
        bar/lua/mod.dll
